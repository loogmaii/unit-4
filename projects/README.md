# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem Definition
 
Client X is one of the pet owners that is currently facing difficulties in finding a suitable platform to connect their pets with other animal owners. This lack of a centralized platform results in a limited opportunity for pets to socialize, and for owners to share advice, recommendations, stories and even find potential playmates or mates for their pets. Moreover, the current process of finding a community is time-consuming and often frustrating due to the lack of a single platform for pet owners to view posts made by other pet owners, express support for the posts shared by other pet owners, and provide detailed information about their pets to potential playmates or mates.
 
## Design Statement

I will design and develop a social media platform for pets. This platform will allow pet owners to create profiles for their pets, share photos and videos, and connect with other pet owners. The platform will be developed using HTML, Bootstrap CSS, Python, SQLite, and the Flask framework. It will take approximately 4 weeks to develop and will be evaluated based on the given criteria.

## Rationale for Proposed Solution

I'm developing a web application for a pet-focused social media network. Pet owners will be able to create profiles for their pets on the site, share pictures and videos of them, and interact with other pet owners. This is due to the fact that mobile applications are made exclusively for mobile devices, whereas online applications may be viewed on any device with a web browser.

HTML, a common markup language for online pages and web apps, is what I'm utilizing to design the user interface for the social networking platform. I am utilizing Bootstrap CSS, which has a mobile-first approach and responsiveness, to make sure the platform is available on a variety of devices and screen sizes.

From Python's extensive library selection, which will allow me to match the platform's requirements for large-scale web apps, I have chosen to use it for this project. Flask is the framework I chose because of its versatility, which is necessary for specialized web apps. Flask's compatibility with a variety of technologies enables me to adapt the platform to pet owners' requirements.

I have selected SQLite as the platform's database since it is open source and runs on a single file, and requires no additional server processes. Because it is made to efficiently manage vast volumes of data and can store many forms of information swiftly and reliably, SQLite is perfect for the platform's requirements. It is also a dependable, effective, and affordable choice for the social networking platform.

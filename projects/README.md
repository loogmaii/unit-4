# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem Definition
 
Pet owners are currently struggling to find a suitable platform to connect with other animal owners, which results in a lack of socialization opportunities for their pets. Additionally, pet owners find it challenging to provide detailed information about their pets to potential playmates or mates, share stories about their pets, and share them with others. Furthermore, there is no central location for pet owners to view posts made by other pet owners, and they lack a way to express support for the posts shared by other pet owners. This time-consuming and limited process of finding a community can be frustrating for them.

## Design Statement

I will design and develop a social media platform for pets. This platform will allow pet owners to create profiles for their pets, share photos and videos, and connect with other pet owners. The platform will be developed using HTML, Bootstrap CSS, Python, SQLite, and the Flask framework. It will take approximately 4 weeks to develop and will be evaluated based on the given criteria.

## Rationale for Proposed Solution

I'm developing a web application for a pet-focused social media network. Pet owners will be able to create profiles for their pets on the site, share pictures and videos of them, and interact with other pet owners. This is due to the fact that mobile applications are made exclusively for mobile devices, whereas online applications may be viewed on any device with a web browser.

HTML, a common markup language for online pages and web apps, is what I'm utilizing to design the user interface for the social networking platform. I am utilizing Bootstrap CSS, which has a mobile-first approach and responsiveness, to make sure the platform is available on a variety of devices and screen sizes.

From Python's extensive library selection, which will allow me to match the platform's requirements for large-scale web apps, I have chosen to use it for this project. Flask is the framework I chose because of its versatility, which is necessary for specialized web apps. Flask's compatibility with a variety of technologies enables me to adapt the platform to pet owners' requirements.

I have selected SQLite as the platform's database since it is open source and runs on a single file, and requires no additional server processes. Because it is made to efficiently manage vast volumes of data and can store many forms of information swiftly and reliably, SQLite is perfect for the platform's requirements. It is also a dependable, effective, and affordable choice for the social networking platform.

## Success criteria

1. The website will incorporate a secure registration and login system.
2. The platform will provide a profile creation feature for pets, enabling clients to add details such as breed, name, and a brief overview of their pet.
3. The user-friendly interface will allow clients to create posts about their pets, complete with an option to add images, descriptions, and dates.
4. The website will give the client access to view posts made by other pet owners.
5. The platform will offer a 'like' feature, allowing clients to express support for the posts shared by other pet owners.
6. The platform will permit clients to view and connect with other pet owners by accessing their profiles.
